# Dental tooth fairy website

We remove tooth without asking. Free of cost.

This project uses nodejs, passportjs, css, tailwindcss, node mailer, postgress db, etc, under the hood.

Essentially, this is a demo website We've create to flex our might in this ocean of noob developers. Unless you're are noob yourself, don't even think about cloning and stealing out website. 

This is a collective initiative by Ayeesha and Donald duck.

If you are thinking of cloning or forking this project please consider supporting my hard work by give a start to this repo. 

The website is deployed [here](wait_for_deployment).
